## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend tool to build web applications
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to add custom styles in tailwind.
```js
colors: {
  primary: {
    cyan: 'var(--light-cyan)',
    green: 'var(--neon-green)'
  },
  'dark-grayish-blue': 'var(--dark-grayish-blue)'
}
```
Also I improve my knoledge in css with the hover effects and understanding more deeply attributes like the dropshadow
```css
hover:drop-shadow-[0_0_10px_var(--neon-green)]
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more in css styles, this is because the styling of the page was the part of the project that took me more time.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) - This helped me a lot with the tailwind classes and for the customization
- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN docs are simply so useful when you are looking for sintax or implementation of html elements and css attributes
